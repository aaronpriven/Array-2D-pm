Revision history for Perl extension Array-2D

{{$NEXT}}

0.001_005 2017-07-07T05:40:01Z

     - Removed Perl 5.8 support, since I wasn't able to install
       Perl 5.8 to test it locally and my attempt to guard against
       invalid escape codes wasn't successful.

     - In tests, changed List::Util::uniq to List::MoreUtils::uniq and
       removed pointless inclusion of (no longer used) Test::Warn.

     - Added new code to use "\n" instead of "\R" as the line 
       delimiter when running under perls before 5.10.

    - Corrected the loading of test modules so it works
      in more perls (I hope -- thank you CPAN Testers!)

    - Identified some more similar modules to list in
      documentation

    - Use any, all, none from List::MoreUtils instead of List::Util,
      since we are already requiring List::MoreUtils and those were
      only added to List::Util relatively recently.

    - Required a version of List::MoreUtils with current behavior for
      any, all, and none.  Version 0.28 came out in 2010.

    - Documentation fixes.

    - Rename test files so they don't contain spaces.
