    - Corrected the loading of test modules so it works
      in more perls (I hope -- thank you CPAN Testers!)

    - Identified some more similar modules to list in
      documentation

    - Use any, all, none from List::MoreUtils instead of List::Util,
      since we are already requiring List::MoreUtils and those were
      only added to List::Util relatively recently.

    - Required a version of List::MoreUtils with current behavior for
      any, all, and none.  Version 0.28 came out in 2010.

    - Documentation fixes.

    - Rename test files so they don't contain spaces.
